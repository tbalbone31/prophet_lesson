# Time Series and Prophet Forecasting

This repo contains code and a html file to support additional independent learning on the Time Series and Prophet Forecasting introductory lesson.

Whilst the code is not essential to meet the learning objectives of the session and not required during the delivery, it will help consolidate and expand your understanding of the concepts covered and help build your experience using Python and Facebook Prophet to undertake some simple time series modelling.

If you're not familiar with Github, please click the blue 'Code' button and download a zip file.  Extract this somewhere on your computer where you will remember it.

Attendees will need some basic understanding of python, Jupyter notebooks, Anaconda Prompt and have installed the latest version of Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).  

A new python environment can be set up using the instructions for installing environments from a file (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) and the file prophet_lesson.yml in the Github repository.
